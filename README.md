# DBOS Cloud Account Management

This repo contains code for our cloud account management app, which is built with DBOS Transact and Stripe, and deployed on DBOS Cloud.

## Overview
When a customer clicks "Upgrade to DBOS Pro" on our [website](https://www.dbos.dev/pricing), this app redirects them to a customized Stripe checkout page, where they enter payment information. After they pay, Stripe sends a notification to a webhook endpoint on this app. The webhook retrieves the customer's updated subscription status from Stripe, maps their Stripe customer ID to a DBOS Cloud account ID, and updates their subscription status in DBOS Cloud.

This repo demonstrates a complete production DBOS application, including cloud deployment and CI/CD, written in <500 lines of code. Specifically, it highlights:

- Use of DBOS workflows, transactions, and communicators for reliable, exactly-once execution
- Asynchronous and reliable event processing for [Stripe Webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)
- Integration with [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) and [Stripe Customer Portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)
- Integration with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication and authorization
- Using [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) for schema management and queries
- Automated testing and deployment with DBOS CLI and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Unit tests for individual functions and endpoints with [jest](https://jestjs.io/).
